# acs-pandas-dataflow
Old and new versions of the Jupyter notebooks we use to clean Census data.

This Github, in the New section, contains datasets for
- Income
- Population
- Age
- Race/ethnicity
- Housing value
- Housing costs
based on 2013-2017 American Community Survey data.

The New section also contains Jupyter notebooks that were used to create each dataset based on the Census API. Which you can re-use, with some careful re-checking of the variables each year.

The old section contains roughly the same files for 2012-2016.
